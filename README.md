# ReinforcementLearning

Utilizing reinforcement learning techniques, the objective is to dynamically maneuver the plane to maintain the ball's position on the playing surface. 
When the ball falls off the plane, a negative reward is assigned. 
Subsequently, the weights and biases of the learning algorithm are recalculated to refine the decision-making process.
